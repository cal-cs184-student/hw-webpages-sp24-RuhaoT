# Homework2: Meshedit Overview

## Overview
From this homework, we learned and practiced the following concepts:
- **Halfedge Mesh**: We implemented a halfedge mesh data structure and various operations on it.
- **MeshEdit**: We implemented various mesh editing operations, such as edge flip, edge split, and vertex split.
- **Bezier Curve and Patch**: We implemented the de Casteljau's algorithm to evaluate points on a BÃ©zier curve and patch.

Besides key concepts, throughout the homework, we also learned about the following:
- **Debugging large codebase**: We learned how to debug a large, unfamiliar codebase.
- **Code organization**: We learned how to make code more readable and maintainable.

We implemented the following updates to the website:
- Added `.csv` table support
- Added print webpage button for each page
