# Homework 1: Rasterizer Overview

## Overview
In this homework, we implement a rasterizer that:

- Able to rasterize triangles, points and lines
- Support supersampling
- Support multiple sampling techniques: nearest and bilinear
- Support level sampling
- Support multiple level sampling techniques: level 0, nearest and interpolation

We also implement the translation, scaling and rotation of SVG elements, and created our own SVG robot figure.

We build up our documentation website using markdown and GitHub Pages. Which is the site you are currently viewing. We add navigation bar, table of contents, code syntax highlighting and many other details to make the website more readable.

You can find the detailed implementation and explanation of each task in the following pages. Happy reading!
