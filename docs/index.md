## Welcome!

This is the write-up website for CS184 spring 2024 assignments. Currently, we have Homework 1, Homework 2, and Homework 3 available.

## How to use this website

On the top of the page, you can find a navigation bar that allows you to navigate to different sections. 

On the left side, all the subpages in one section are listed and can be accessed by clicking on them. 

For each subpage, there is a table of contents on the right side that allows you to jump to different parts of the page.
